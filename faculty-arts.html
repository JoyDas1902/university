        <h2>Faculty of Arts</h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          The Faculty of Arts, Jadavpur University started its journey in the
          year 1955 with departments like English, Bengali, Economics,
          Comparative Literature, History, International Relations, Philosophy
          and Sanskrit, having stalwarts in respective fields as their founder
          member. At the initial stage in the history of Jadavpur University,
          the idea was to bind the three faculties with a single tie so that
          students of this University can have an integrated knowledge of their
          language, history and culture along with the studies of their specific
          choice. As days rolled on new departments have been added to the list
          to cater for the needs of the day and to open the door of research on
          contemporary issues to the teachers and students. At present, there
          are thirteen departments and twenty centres under the Faculty of Arts.
          This faculty from its very inception is renowned for its originality
          and uniqueness in syllabus, modern outlook, high standard researches;
          and serves as an exemplary model for other universities, not only in
          the state but in the whole country. Barring a few, most of the
          departments in this faculty have been recognized as the centre of
          Special Assistance (DRS, DSA, CAS) from the UGC for their academic
          excellence. The exchange program, both at the student level and
          teacher level have been successfully running between the Faculty of
          Arts and other distinguished international universities like Momoyama
          Gakuin University, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Bolzano
          University, Italy to mention a few. This Faculty of Arts feels proud
          to have stalwarts like Sushil De, Amartya Sen, Buddhadev Basu,
          Sudhindra Nath Dutta, Susobhan Chandra Sarkar, Gauri Nath Shastri,
          Subodh Chandra Sengupta, Gopinath Bhattacharya, Naresh Chandra Guha,
          Amalendu De, Nemai Sadhan Basu, Pranab Kumar Sen, Debiprasad
          Chattopadhyay, Jayantanuj Bandyopadhyay, Sukumari Bhattacharyya,
          Chinmayi Chatterjee, Sankha Ghosh, Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Sukanta
          Chaudhury, Purushottam Bhattacharyya, Amita Chatterjee as
          distinguished professors in different departments. Among the present
          faculty members, many have been awarded prizes and Fellowships at the
          National and International levels. We do not want to remain content
          with what we have achieved so far. Our vision is to proceed ahead --
          to motivate teachers and students to new and new areas of research at
          intra-departmental, inter-departmental and inter-disciplinary levels.
          Let the young minds have a glimpse of the vast ocean of their
          discipline.
