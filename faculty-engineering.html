        <p class="hidden">
          There are sixteen UG courses, thirty-five PG courses, & numerous Ph.D.
          (Engg.) programs offered under FET. All the courses are duly
          recognized by AICTE/PCI (Pharmacy Council of India)/COA (Council of
          Architecture). Certain unique courses in India, namely UG (Evening 5
          years) & PG (Evening 3 years), have also been offered & organized by
          the FET keeping in view of the demand of our nation. Students from
          different socioeconomic backgrounds & various demographics of our
          country have been getting themselves admitted to our faculty. The
          astounding success and the spectacular accomplishments of our faculty
          (FET) are the results of sustained evolution in the process of
          teaching, learning, research, publication, patents, consultancies,
          training & outreach programs undertaken by our highly motivated,
          dedicated, and internationally reputed faculties. Research projects
          funded by AICTE, UGC, DRDO, DST, MHRD, BARC, ISRO & other agencies
          have been successfully completed & implemented on time. Amongst them,
          the project “ AGNI ” had been widely acknowledged & recognized. FET,
          under the umbrella of TEQIP (Technical Education Quality Improvement
          Program) & RUSA (Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan) also made
          outstanding and magnificent contributions to the growth of our
          motherland. The eclectic, exotic, and holistic courses, offered by
          FET, have been highly appreciated by leading organizations, both
          private & PSU`s who are regular visitors to our campus for training,
          internship, and finally recruitment of our students. The cutting-edge
          curricula & syllabi are regularly monitored & updated in order to keep
          pace with the demand of our societies at national as well as at
          international levels. FET has been continually endeavoring to cater to
          the visions of our visionaries in the most synergistic & scintillating
          ways.
