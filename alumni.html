        <h2>Alumni Association</h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          The Alumni Association, one of the oldest in the country, was founded
          in 1921 by the ex-students of National Council of Education. <br />

          The teachers– builders of the Association, such as Prof. Hiralal Roy,
          Prof. Surendra Kumar Roy, Prof. Hem Chandra Dasgupta and others who
          imbibed the Alumni feeling, established the Alumni (old boys)
          Association of NCE Bengal in the year 1921. Prof. Hiralal Roy A. B.
          (Harvard) became its first secretary and Dr. Abinesh Ch.
          Bhattacharjee, Ph.D. (Berlin) its first present. It was the Alumni who
          from the earliest days to the period shortly before India’s
          Independence, regularly arranged travelling fellowships for junior
          members of the teaching staff for doing doctoral researches in U.K.,
          USA and Germany. <br />

          Shri Kiron Roy, who was an alumnus and an ex-student of M.I.T.
          (Boston), founded his Electrical firm in Calcutta and helped the
          College of Engineering and Technology in various ways. The alumni of
          Jadavpur living abroad helped fellow-Jadavpurians to be admitted to
          various universities and research institutions in Boston, Michigan,
          Pittsburgh, Cornell, Edinburg, Munich etc. <br />

          It is significant that a sizeable portion of the members on the
          Managing Committee of Jadavpur College, before it become a University,
          comprised Jadavpurians who had their Engineering diplomas and degrees
          from N.C.E. itself. Thus the alumni used to have a role in the
          management, control and development of continuity and perpetuation of
          the Jadavpur stamp and tradition, strengthening the tie between the
          old and the new. The Old Boys Home on the campus stood, as it also
          stands now, as a symbol of this bond of brotherhood. <br />
          <br />
          Within a short time it began to organize sports, musical soirees,
          exhibitions, conferences and established branches in different parts
          of the country, and even in U.K. and U.S.A. On the occasion of Silver
          Jubilee of NCE in 1946 it collected several lakhs for its Alma Mater.
          It may be mentioned that the famous painter Atul Bose was an alumnus
          of Jadavpur and donated a lump sum on the occasion. To help the
          brother students, the Alumni Association introduced several loan
          scholarships. One of the very helpful activities of the Alumni
          Association was to secure jobs in industries and organizations for the
          young Jadavpurians. It was a laudable job in those most difficult days
          of widespread unemployment. <br />

          For the first few years of its existence, the activities of the Alumni
          Association were mainly educational, practically confined to the
          guidance of and assistance to the NCE and the development of the BTI
          (Bengal Technical Institute). The connections of the Alumni
          Association with the NCE, the BTI and, later, the College of
          Engineering & Technology (CET) considerably helped these institutions
          to spread and improve engineering and technological education in
          India. The NCE was a private organization. Its formation, operation
          and development had to be funded entirely by public donations, with no
          Government support. The Alumni Association became a vital factor in
          the growth of the NCE and development of the CET. <br />
          <br />
          The construction of the K. C. Roy Hall in the Electrical Engineering
          Building, expansion of the Chemical Engineering Building, construction
          of the Gymnasium (now Indoor Stadium), a revolving Theatrical Stage,
          the Wind Mills for pumping out the water from the Play Grounds are all
          Alumni creations. As regards the Alumni Building, the present home of
          the Association, a two storied building was built in 1941 at the
          north-western corner of the University playgrounds. The cost of
          construction was Rs. 18,000/-, fully financed by the Alumni. The
          original name of the building was the “Old Boys Home”. When girl
          ex-students became a reality, the home was renamed as the “Alumni
          Building”. The ground floor of the building is being used by the
          students of Jadavpur University taking part in sports and games as a
          pavilion ever since the completion of the building. Justice Charu
          Chandra Biswas of the Calcutta High Court inaugurated the building in
          December 1941. A portion of the first floor of the building had been
          converted to a guesthouse. Although on meagre scale, this has been a
          step towards solving the problem of accommodation of persons coming to
          the University from outstations. <br />
          After the formation of the Jadavpur University in 1955 the rules were
          modified to include ex-students of the University as alumni. The name
          of the Association itself was formally changed and registered in 1990
          as “The Alumni Association, NCE Bengal and Jadavpur University. <br />

          If one goes through the list of Presidents and Secretaries, given
          later, the involvement of those alumni, along with many other unnamed
          contemporaries, will be understood.

        <h2><u>Vision and Priorities</u></h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          The Jadavpur University Alumni Association (JUAA) is an organization
          that represents the alumni of Jadavpur University, a premier
          educational institution in India. The association aims to foster a
          strong relationship between the university and its alumni, as well as
          among alumni themselves. <br />
          The JUAA has a number of objectives, including: <br />
          1. Building and maintaining a network of alumni who can help each
          other in personal and professional growth. <br />
          2. Supporting the development of the university by providing financial
          and other resources. <br />
          3. Encouraging alumni to participate in activities and events that
          promote the university. <br />
          4.Helping current students by providing mentorship, internships, and
          job opportunities. <br />
          The JUAA also organizes a range of events and activities, such as
          reunions, networking events, and workshops, to facilitate
          communication and collaboration among alumni. The association also
          provides a platform for alumni to share their experiences and success
          stories, which can inspire current students and younger alumni. The
          JUAA is an important part of the Jadavpur University community,
          helping to strengthen the bond between the university and its
          graduates. Through its activities and initiatives, the association
          promotes the values of the university and encourages alumni to
          continue to contribute to the growth and development of the
          institution.
