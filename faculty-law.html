          Beginning in 1987, Jadavpur University established Schools of
          Interdisciplinary Studies that provided a collective platform for
          innovative research and teaching. The areas of study included
          Nanotechnology, Women`s Studies, Education Technology, Cognitive
          Science, Water Resources Engineering, Environmental Science,
          Oceanography and Mobile Computing, among others. These schools
          attracted both international and national funding, and were brought
          together under the ambit of the newly-formed Faculty of
          Interdisciplinary Studies, Law, and Management (FISLM) in 2011, which
          now consists of 21 Schools and one Department.
