        <h2><u>Message from the Administration</u></h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          Jadavpur University is an outcome of nationalist movement initiated in
          the early twentieth century by the intellectuals and thinkers of
          Bengal. In addition to a rich heritage of the Faculties of
          Engineering, Arts and Science the University has a large number of
          Interdisciplinary Schools under the Faculty of Interdisciplinary
          Studies, Law and Management. In the present age, the traditionally
          rigid boundaries of disciplines are removed and the subjects are
          divided and subdivided into smaller units that cris-cross and mix
          together to form new interdisciplinary ideas. The close association of
          members of different faculties has facilitated them to take full
          advantage of this effect. The untiring effort of the faculty members
          and staff and the enthusiasm of the brightest students have catapulted
          the University to the top rank in research and teaching in the
          country.

        <h2><u>Admission</u></h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          Admission to Jadavpur University, though extremely competitive, is
          through a completely transparent and student-friendly process, from
          application to publication of admission test results; details are
          available to anyone who enquires. The process is reviewed annually and
          improvements are implemented (e.g. making applications to all courses
          at the Faculty of Arts online) on a regular basis. Students from
          backward and disadvantaged sections of society, especially those from
          remote rural areas, are encouraged to apply and there are many schemes
          and programmes for such students.
