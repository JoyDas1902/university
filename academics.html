        <h2>Establishment</h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          In 1910, the Society for the Promotion of Technical Education in
          Bengal which looked after Bengal Technical Institute (which later
          became College of Engineering and Technology, Bengal) was amalgamated
          to NCE. NCE henceforth looked after the College of Engineering and
          Technology, Bengal. After Independence, on 24 December 1955, Jadavpur
          University was officially established by the Government of West Bengal
          with the concurrence of the Government of India. The departments of
          Jadavpur University are divided into four faculties councils - (I)
          Faculty of Arts (II) Faculty of Science, (III) Faculty of Engineering
          & Technology, (IV) I.S.L.M. In addition to being a unitary university,
          it has other institutes like the J D Birla Institute, and the
          Institute of Business Management affiliated to it, which operate out
          of independent campuses. While these institutes have their own
          independent curriculum as well as examination systems, the final
          degree is offered by Jadavpur University. To facilitate
          interdisciplinary learning and research in diverse fields, there are a
          number of schools and centre for studies. Some of the major research
          ventures undertaken by these schools include the pioneering work done
          by the School of Environmental Studies in highlighting the presence of
          arsenic in groundwater in countries like India and Bangladesh and the
          development of the first alcohol based car by the School of Automobile
          Engineering.

          All departments, interdisciplinary schools, centres and special
          programmes are engaged in research. Recognition and praise have come
          from assessment and ranking bodies, both national and international,
          and Jadavpur University has received substantial grants from funding
          agencies, including UGC-SAP, DST-PURSE, TEQIP, SYLFF, Erasmus+, the
          European Union, RUSA, among others. As many as thirty teachers of the
          university find places in the list of the top 2% of the world`s
          scientists, prepared by Stanford University (2020), the highest among
          Indian universities. Thrust areas for research are decided upon at the
          university, faculty, department and school levels, apart from special
          research programmes cutting across disciplines and departments.

        <h2><u>Innovation</u></h2>
        <p class="hidden">
          Jadavpur University has consistently pursued innovation, not for its
          own sake but for the greater good of society. This quest has received
          recognition and accolades from domestic and international agencies and
          bodies, academic and otherwise. It is engaged in the development and
          validation of different types of indigenous knowledge and has long
          been pursuing R&D and unique inventions in multiple areas of strategic
          importance with potential for local, national, and global knowledge
          enhancement and social change. The university nurtures innovation and
          creativity across disciplinary boundaries by creating flexible and
          adaptive spaces where new experiments in thought, new technologies,
          and new knowledge practices can be generated.
